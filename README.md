First the developer writes some tests.
The developer then runs those tests and (obviously) they fail because none of those features are actually implemented.
Next the developer actually implements those tests in code.
If the developer writes their code well, then the in next stage they will see that their tests pass.
The developer can then refactor their code, add comments and clean it up, as they wish because the developer knows that if the new code breaks something, then the tests will be an alert by failing.
